# Ravnenous

Ravenous is a single-page React application designed to search for restaurants using the Yelp API. 

## Technologies 

This React app was built using the Node.js [create-react-app command]([url](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)), which automates preprocessing with Babel and bundling with Webpack. The technology stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and additional tools such as Git and GitHub for version control, HTTP Requests and Responses for data communication, and Authentication for secure user access.

## Features

* The website allows users to scroll up and down to navigate through its content.
* Users can simulate a search by typing in the search bar.
* A list of mock restaurant data is presented to the user.
* Information is transferred efficiently between components using a unidirectional data flow pattern commonly used in React applications.
