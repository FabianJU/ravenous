# Ravnenous

Ravenous is a single-page React application designed to search for restaurants using the Yelp API. 

## Technologies 

This React app was built using the Node.js [create-react-app command]([url](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app)), which automates preprocessing with Babel and bundling with Webpack. The technology stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and additional tools such as Git and GitHub for version control, HTTP Requests and Responses for data communication, and Authentication for secure user access.

## Features

* Users can search for restauraunts by name and location, and sort their results by best match, highest rated, or most reviewed.
* Restauraunt data is fetched using the Yelp API and results are displayed with restauraunts' photos, addresses, cuisine, and ratings/review counts.
* Information is transferred efficiently between components using a unidirectional data flow pattern commonly used in React applications.

## Local setup

To set up the project locally from the "ravenous" directory, execute the following CLI commands:
### npm install 
This command installs all Node dependencies for React and other third-party packages used in the project.
### npm start
Launches the app in development mode using node server.js. Access it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The page automatically reloads on source code edits, and linting errors are displayed in the console.
